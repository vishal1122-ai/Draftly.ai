NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (MUTUAL)

PARTIES AND PURPOSE
This Non-Disclosure Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between Alpha Corp (“Discloser/Recipient”) and Beta LLC (“Recipient/Discloser”) for the sole purpose of evaluating a potential business relationship (the “Proposed Relationship”).

DEFINITIONS
“Confidential Information” means non-public information disclosed by either party, whether oral, written, or electronic, including business plans, product designs, source code, pricing, customer lists, and technical data.

EXCLUSIONS (EXCEPTIONS)
Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is or becomes public through no fault of the Recipient; (b) was known to the Recipient prior to disclosure; (c) is independently developed by the Recipient without use of the Discloser’s information; or (d) is required to be disclosed by law or court order.

CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS
Recipient shall keep Discloser’s Confidential Information strictly confidential and shall not disclose it to any third party except to employees, contractors, or advisors who have a need-to-know and are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective. Recipient shall implement reasonable safeguards to protect such information.

USE RESTRICTIONS
Recipient shall use the Confidential Information solely for evaluating the Proposed Relationship and for no other purpose, and shall not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any materials provided by Discloser.

RETURN OR DESTRUCTION OF MATERIALS
Upon Discloser’s request or upon termination of discussions, Recipient shall promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information, including all copies and backups, and will certify destruction upon request.

TERM AND SURVIVAL
This Agreement becomes effective on the last signature date and remains in effect for two (2) years. Confidentiality obligations with respect to trade secrets survive as long as such information remains a trade secret.

NO LICENSE
No license or ownership rights are granted under this Agreement except the limited right to use Confidential Information as expressly set forth.

REMEDIES; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
The parties acknowledge that a breach may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages would be inadequate; therefore, the Discloser is entitled to equitable and injunctive relief, without posting bond, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.

GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of law rules. The parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in New Castle County, Delaware.

MISCELLANEOUS
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding its subject matter and may be amended only in writing signed by both parties. If any provision is found unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect.
